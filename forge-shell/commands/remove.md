# /shell:remove

All plugins are built into Forge Shell. They cannot be removed, but they can be hidden from the sidebar.

## Steps

1. Explain to the user:
   - "Forge Shell plugins are built-in and cannot be removed. To hide a plugin from the sidebar, click the **pencil icon** at the bottom of the sidebar to enter edit mode, then click the **eye icon** next to the plugin you want to hide."
   - "Hidden plugins are remembered across sessions. You can re-enable them at any time using the same edit mode."
   - "Run `/shell:open` to launch the dashboard."
