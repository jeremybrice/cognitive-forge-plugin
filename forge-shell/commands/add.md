# /shell:add

All plugins are built into Forge Shell and enabled by default. There is no need to register plugins manually.

## Steps

1. Explain to the user:
   - "All Forge plugins (Cognitive Forge, Product Forge, Productivity) are built into the Forge Shell app. No registration or setup is needed."
   - "If a plugin is hidden from the sidebar, click the **pencil icon** at the bottom of the sidebar to enter edit mode, then toggle visibility with the **eye icon** next to each plugin."
   - "Run `/shell:open` to launch the dashboard."
